<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello All and Welcome!</h2>

<p>I wanted to share a little bit about myself so you can get to know me and what I am all about. I hope you have enjoyed the site so far and hope you follow me on my journey.

<p>I started my formal "Tech Journey" many years ago when I joined the military. I was an aviation communication systems technician. In other words I set up, maintained and monitored a system that helped operators coordinate with aircraft to get various things done accomplished. I set up trucks filled with radios and switches and servers amongst other equipment. These trucks were connected to tents and building where the operators worked. I also set up and maintained the computers they worked on and their telephones and networks. While everything was running smoothly I monitored the whole operation from a remote location.

<p>After the military I spent my time chasing my dreams while I was still young. I pursued a degree in law enforcement and eventually ended up as a volunteer Firefighter and I absolutely loved it. I turned this love into my career and still fight fires today as a full time job. I recently got promoted to an Engineer (Driver and operator) though hard work and studying. But I always felt a strong pull back to what I loved about the job I did in the military.

<p>When I decided that I was ready for my next challenge I applied for an Associates degree program in Information Technology with a focus on Programming and Web Development. While I have been in this program I have heavily engaged in self teaching these subjects (Hence this course). I have stayed open minded to new technologies and have dabbled in many different areas. Programming has been my focus but Web Development is also very interesting to me and I recently got more involved in Data Analysis and Management.
